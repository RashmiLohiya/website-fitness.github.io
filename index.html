             <p class="bigtext">FITNESS IS REFLECTION OF LIFESTYLE</p>
             <p class="smalltext">Fitness is defined as the quality or state of being fit and healthy. Around 1950, perhaps consistent with the Industrial Revolution and the treatise of World War II, the term "fitness" increased in western vernacular by a factor of ten. The modern definition of fitness describes either a person or machine's ability to perform a specific function or a holistic definition of human adaptability to cope with various situations. This has led to an interrelation of human fitness and physical attractiveness that has mobilized global fitness and fitness equipment industries. Regarding specific function, fitness is attributed to persons who possess significant aerobic or anaerobic ability. A well-rounded fitness program improves a person in all aspects of fitness compared to practicing only one, such as only cardio/respiratory or only weight training.

        <p class="sectionsubtag smalltext">
             Experts define physical fitness as one’s ability to execute daily activities with optimal performance, endurance, and strength with the management of disease, fatigue, and stress and reduced sedentary behavior.”
             This description goes beyond being able to run quickly or lift heavy weights. Despite being important, these attributes only address single areas of fitness.
             Being physically fit depends on how well a person fulfills each of the components of being healthy.

        <p class="sectionsubtag smalltext">There are three kinds of fitness: <br>
            1. Aerobic fitness: Aerobic activities condition your heart and lungs. <br>
            2. Muscle strengthening: Stronger muscles can mean either more powerful muscles that can do bigger jobs (such as lifting heavier weights) or muscles that will work longer before becoming exhausted. <br>
            3. Flexibility.
